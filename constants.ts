COTTAGE HOME CARE SERVICES TRAINING MODULE: INTAKE GUIDELINES

Overview
An Intake Coordinator in a home care agency is the first point of contact for new clients. They help gather and organize all the information needed to begin home care services. Their role is to make sure the process runs smoothly from the first phone call to the start of care.

Key Duties:
•	Receive Referrals: Take calls or emails from Marketers, Nursing homes, or families.
•	Collect Information: Get client details (medicaid, personal informations).
•	Verify Insurance: Confirm coverage with insurance or Medicare/Medicaid.
•	Explain Services: Help clients and families understand the process.
•	Follow Up: Track cases, complete paperwork, and ensure readiness.
•	Maintain Records: Keep accurate and confidential files.


What is Long-Term Care?
Definition:
Long-term care is a coordinated service plan developed in collaboration with the patient and their insurance provider to support extended care needs. Patients may choose from the following options:
1.	CDPAP (Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program)
o	Allows a family member (excluding legally married spouses) to serve as a paid caregiver.
2.	HHA/PCA (Home Health Aide / Personal Care Assistant)
o	Cottage Home Care provides a trained aide to assist the patient.



Important Notes:
•	Services continue through the end of the patient’s life, until Medicaid is active
•	Medicaid typically covers the costs, with no out-of-pocket expenses for the patient. Medicaid covers the costs of the affiliated services.
•	The process includes:
o	Two evaluations conducted in person or via video call by a state-authorized nurse.
o	Care hours are approved following the evaluations.
Additional Services Available:
•	Assistance with food stamps, cash assistance, and rental assistance.
•	Rates vary by location and will be discussed during the intake process.

NYIA Assessment :
NYIA stands for New York Independent Assessor. It is a mandatory medical assessment process for people in New York State who are applying for long-term home care services through Medicaid.
The NYIA assessment helps determine if a person is medically eligible to receive community-based long-term care, such as:
•	Personal Care Aide (PCA)
•	Home Health Aide (HHA)
•	Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP)
________________________________________
🧑‍⚕️ Who Does the Assessment?
The assessment is done by an independent nurse assigned by the New York State Department of Health, not by the Medicaid plan or home care agency.

•	The NYIA assessment is valid for one year.
•	If a member does not use home care services for more than 45 days, they must complete the assessment again before resuming services.
Patient Preparation:
•	Schedule via video call
•	Instruct patients to let the nurse lead the conversation—do not offer unsolicited info

Scoring Examples:
•	Cannot walk = 10 points
•	Bedbound = 15 points (covers ADLs like brushing teeth, bathing, cooking, etc.)

What is the MLTC RN Assessment?
The MLTC RN Assessment is a medical evaluation done by a Registered Nurse (RN) from a Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) Plan. It is part of the process for starting Medicaid-funded home care services in New York State.
This assessment happens after the person has been approved by the New York Independent Assessor (NYIA).
________________________________________
🧭 Purpose:
The MLTC RN Assessment helps the MLTC plan:
•	Understand the patient’s daily care needs
•	Decide the type and number of hours of home care services (e.g., Personal Care Aide, Home Health Aide)
•	Develop a custom care plan
________________________________________
👩‍⚕️ Who Does It?
A Registered Nurse (RN) employed by or contracted with the MLTC plan chosen by the patient.
________________________________________







📋 What Happens During the Assessment?
The nurse will:
•	Visit the patient at home (in person or virtually)
•	Ask questions about:
o	Medical history
o	Medications
o	Mobility (walking, standing, etc.)
o	Daily activities (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting)
o	Mental health or memory issues
•	Evaluate if the patient is safe to remain at home
________________________________________
⏱ When It Happens:
•	After NYIA approves the patient for long-term care
•	Before the person can be enrolled in the MLTC plan
•	Often repeated annually or if the person’s condition changes
________________________________________
✅ Why It’s Important:
This assessment determines:
•	How many hours of care the person gets
•	What kind of services and support they qualify for
•	Whether any special equipment or nursing visits are needed
________________________________________
🔑 In Summary:
The MLTC RN Assessment is the nurse visit done by the MLTC plan to:
•	Finalize the care plan
•	Approve the number of hours of in-home help
•	Make sure services match the person’s needs
MLTC RN Assessment H-78 Code Guidelines
________________________________________
Eligibility for Medicaid
1. Age & Disability Criteria:
•	Individuals aged 65 or older automatically qualify for Medicaid.
•	Individuals under 65 may qualify only if they have a disability determination from the Social Security Income (SSI) office.
________________________________________
Medicaid Coverage and H-78 Code
•	If a member qualifies for Medicaid but does not meet regular eligibility criteria, they may receive Medicaid through the Marketplace (NYSOH, New York State of Health) under code H-78.

Restrictions with H-78:
•	Members with this code cannot receive home care services directly.
•	To obtain home care, the member must complete additional steps.
________________________________________
Home Care Options
1. If the Member Wants MLTC Services (Managed Long-Term Care):
•	They must undergo a NYIA (New York Independent Assessor) assessment.
•	During the assessment, the member must express their need for MLTC services.
•	Once approved, Medicaid coverage will shift from the Marketplace to HRA (Human Resources Administration) or DSS (Department of Social Services).
•	The member must accept POC so that MLTC plan can submit a conversion request to Maximus. This transition takes up to 6-8 weeks.
2. If the Member Wants Home Care but Not MLTC:
•	They may receive home care through an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) program.
•	The H-78 code will remain in this case.
MLTC RN Assessment Code-54 – Restriction/Exception (RE) Code
•	In the New York State Medicaid program, Code 54 is a Restriction/Exception (RE) code indicating that a member's outpatient Medicaid coverage is limited to Home Health, Personal Care Services, and the Resources are not verified
•	This means the individual is eligible only for these specific services and does not have full Medicaid coverage for other outpatient services/ Home care services.
________________________________________
Transition from Limited to Comprehensive Medicaid Benefits
To transition from this limited coverage to comprehensive Medicaid benefits that include community-based long-term care services, the following steps are typically required:
1. Complete the MAP-751W Form
•	Used to request a change in Medicaid coverage from "Community Coverage to Community-Based Long-Term Care (CBLTC)
2. Submit Financial Documentation
•	Bank Statements: Provide bank statements for the last three months to verify financial eligibility.
•	Letter of Support: If the applicant does not have a bank account:
o	A letter explaining the absence of bank accounts or financial assets should be provided.
o	This letter should detail how the individual manages daily expenses and may need to be notarized or accompanied by supporting documentation.
3. If They Have Medicare:
•	Social Security Income Award Letter: Submit the most recent award letter indicating the current benefit amount.
o	Particularly important if the individual has additional income, as it assists in determining Medicaid eligibility and any potential cost-sharing responsibilities.
4. If They Do Not Have Medicare:
•	Disability Award Letter
________________________________________


Referral Recommendations Based on Code Type
•	For Code 54: Send the referral to Centers Plan Insurance because they are more active.
•	Do not send to Elderplan for Code 54 because they don’t handle communications properly.
•	For Code 78: Send to Elderplan because they remove that code earlier than others.

Important forms
(POA) (HCP) Authorized Representative
________________________________________
🧾 1. Power of Attorney (POA)
Example:
John, a 72-year-old man, appoints his daughter Emily as his Power of Attorney. This means Emily can:
•	Pay his bills
•	Manage his bank account
•	Sell property if needed
Even if John becomes too sick to manage these things, Emily can still act for him, as long as it’s a Durable POA.
________________________________________



🏥 2. Health Care Proxy (Medical POA)
Example:
Maria, 65, is having surgery. She fills out a Health Care Proxy form and names her brother Carlos.
During surgery, Maria has complications and becomes unconscious. The doctors need a decision on a risky treatment.
Carlos now has the legal right to make medical decisions for Maria, based on her wishes.
________________________________________
🧾 3. Authorized Representative
Example:
Denise, age 58, is applying for Medicaid but struggles with the forms. She names her friend Lisa as her Authorized Representative just for that application.
Lisa can:
•	Call Medicaid on Denise’s behalf
•	Get updates
•	Submit paperwork
But Lisa cannot make financial or medical decisions—only help with this one process.
________________________________________

Medicaid Eligibility & Surplus Income
________________________________________
Asset Limits:
•	If single, you cannot have more than $1,800 income.
•	If married, the limit is $2,433.
________________________________________
Surplus Income (Spend-down):
•	If your income exceeds Medicaid’s limit, the extra amount is called the surplus.
•	You must pay this surplus each month to keep your Medicaid active.
Example:
•	If a single person earns $2,000/month (while the limit is $1,800), they have a $200 surplus, which they must pay.
________________________________________
Pooled Income Trust (PIT) – A Way to Reduce Surplus Payments
•	A Pooled Income Trust allows individuals to reduce their surplus payment by contributing only a portion of it.
________________________________________
Contribution Structure:
•	Instead of paying the full surplus, you only need to contribute 10% of that amount.
Limits:
•	Minimum payment: $30/month
•	Maximum payment: $250/month
•	One-Time Signup Fee: $250
________________________________________
Examples:
•	If your surplus is $200, your PIT payment is $20 (10%), but since the minimum is $30, you pay $30.
•	If your surplus is $3,000, your PIT payment is $250 (capped at the maximum).
•	This trust helps Medicaid applicants keep more of their income while staying eligible for benefits.
________________________________________
Additional Asset & Property Rules
•	If you have over $30,000 in assets, you are not eligible for Medicaid.
•	If you own property worth more than $1 million, you are not eligible.
